# Sources for: Path integral spin dynamics for quantum paramagnets

This repository contains source code which implements a path integral approach to calculate the thermodynamics of quantum spin for a quantum paramagnet with easy axis along the applied field direction and with compressive/tensile stress along the same direction. It contains functions for analytic solutions and a numerical approach based on atomistic spin dynamics.

## Description

This is a simple code for atomistic simulations for a single spin for a quantum paramagnet with easy axis along the applied field direction (arbitrary choice of z-axis here) and with compressive/tensile stress along the same direction. It computes both the classical limit and quantum corrections of the thermal expectation value of the z-component of the spin. 

There are two approximation schemes included: The first one is a "high" temperature approximation, and the second one is a exact method which directly takes a log function as the Hamiltonian.

Also included are exact results computed from the partition function for the quantum case.

## Reproduction

 The `make` build tool can be used to execute the Makefile and re-produce all of the figures. The steps to reproduce are:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate quantum_spin_dynamics
make clean
make
```

Note that the the atomistic spin dynamics are stochastic so the results will differ slightly due to random seeding.

## Code use for general calculations

The python/pisd.py script can be used to generate data with different integration methods, approximations and spin values.

Using the provided environment.yml file, create a conda environment in your terminal:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate quantum_spin_dynamics
```

Then run the python/pisd.py script

```bash
python python/pisd.py <options>
```

where the options available are

```text
usage: pisd.py [-h] [--integrator {runge-kutta-4,symplectic}] --approximation {classical-limit, quantum-approximation, quantum-exact} --spin SPIN --field FIELD --stress STRESS --anisotropy ANISOTROPY

Simulation parameters from command line.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --integrator {runge-kutta-4,symplectic}
                        Numerical integration method for solving the spin dynamics
  --approximation {classical-limit,quantum-approximation, quantum-exact}
                            Approximation scheme to use
  --order ORDER             Order of approximation. These are the quantum correction terms to be taken into account for the approximation (3 is the first quantum correction and this is used neither for the classical limit where the order is 2 nor for the "exact" quantum field method)
  --spin SPIN               Quantum spin value (should normally be an integer multiple of 1/2)
  --field FIELD             Z-component of magnetic field (in Tesla)
  --stress STRESS           Applied stress energy (ƛσ in Joules)
  --anisotropy ANISOTROPY   Uniaxial anisotropy energy (K in Joules)
```
  
### Additional variables

Depending on computational resources and specific system, one can change some parameters 
in the python/pisd.py script (or examples scripts as well):
- the value of the gilbert damping `alpha` (default is 0.5)
- the range and increments in temperature for atomistic simulations by 
changing `np.linspace(<starting-temperature>, <final-temperature>, 
<number-of-temperatures-in-range>)`
- the initial spin orientation `s0` (must be of unit norm and different 
from `np.array([0, 0, 1])`
- the equilibration period `equilibration_time`, the computation time `production_time`
and the integration time step `time_step` for each stochastic realisation
- the number of stochastic realisations `num_realisation` of the noise over
which to average the time average

## Notes

The numba package is used for just in time compilation which greatly reduces the calculation time. In principle the `@njit` statements can be removed from all code if numba is not supported on a given platform, but the calculation time will be extremely long.

In python/analytic.py, sympy is used to generate higher order terms for approximations symbolically before being compiled. Without this, each order of approximation would need to be hard coded.

This work is an extension of the method for a single spin in a constant magnetic field from: Thomas Nussle, Stam Nicolis and Joseph Barker, "Numerical simulations of a spin dynamics model based on a path integral approach", [Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043075 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.043075).

By default, the atomistic spin dynamics uses a symplectic integrator described in: Pascal Thibaudeau and David Beaujouan, "Thermostatting the atomic spin dynamics from controlled demons", [Phys. A: Stat. Mech. its Appl. 391, 1963–1971 (2012)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2011.11.030).
